# Refactoring Masterplan

Status date: 2026-06-13 · Baseline analyzed at HEAD `8a1f778b`.

A structural ("how would we build it today") refactoring of Avesmaps that
**preserves all end-user/editor behaviour**. Workflow-affecting changes are
listed in §"Owner decisions" and require sign-off before the relevant milestone.

This document is the living tracker. See `AGENTS.md` for the project brief.

## Goals

1. **Architecture & structure** — split monolithic files, finish the existing
   modular decomposition, tidy stray files & folders.
2. **Code quality** — real dead-code elimination (delete, don't archive), DRY,
   readability for humans *and* AI agents.
3. **API unification** — converge every endpoint on the `route`/`locations`
   contract; **remove all shims/wrappers** (breaking changes allowed; the API is
   internal-only).
4. **Documentation** — translate docs/comments to English; ship a living AI-agent
   memory file (`AGENTS.md`).
5. **Stability/performance/security** — fix discovered bugs, leaks and hotspots
   without changing behaviour.

## Current state (IST) → target (SOLL), in brief

- **Structure:** the `api/{route,locations,app,edit,import,diagnostics,_internal}`
  reorg (from `api-restructure-plan.md`) is **done**; what remains is contract
  unification + shim removal + dissolving 8 JS and 13 PHP God-files and a
  generated CSS artifact committed as source. → cohesive small modules, generated
  artifacts out of source, consolidated tooling.
- **Code quality:** ~1000-line duplicate tree engine in
  `territory-editor-embedded.js`, dead `route-graph-routing` shadow, `valid_to_bf`
  in 4 divergent variants, endpoint preamble duplicated ~26×. → shared
  `territory-utils.js` (JS), request runner + single validity source (PHP).
- **API:** only `route`/`locations` use `{error:{code,message}}` + a dedicated
  helper; everything else returns flat `error:"string"`, with 3 different CORS
  implementations and pervasive `getMessage()` leaks. → one envelope, one CORS
  path, one auth helper, no shims.
- **Docs:** 143 → 25 md files after deleting spent process logs; README/llms.txt/
  site-summary falsely claimed "no backend" (✅ corrected at source `bc175741`). → ~20 authoritative docs in English +
  `AGENTS.md`.
- **Stability:** 3 unauthenticated destructive wiki-dom endpoints, getMessage
  leaks (incl. public `territory-detail.php`), derived-layer N+1, DDL-before-cache.
  → closed/hardened; ~12 verified bugs fixed.

## Milestones

| M | Title | Status | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| **M0** | Cleanup & DCE | ✅ done (`4600cb17`) | −23.5k lines: dropped `.refactor-backup/`, 118 process-log docs, og-image deploy fix, `.gitattributes`, moved `prototype/`→`docs/spikes/` |
| **M0.5** | `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` + this doc | ✅ done | living AI brief + English masterplan |
| **M1** | Security | ✅ done (`7432f1e1`→`09ee68ad`) | neutralized 3 unauth wiki-dom crawler endpoints with 410 stubs + removed dead playground UI (verified `/edit → WikiSync` uses sync-monitor.php, not these); stopped 9 bare-Throwable `getMessage()` leaks; atomic `coat.php` cache write; `add_claim` transaction + `FOR UPDATE`. CORS: 2 of 3 divergent impls gone via stubbing; the wiki-browser `applyCors` (non-exploitable) is deferred to M3 with the parallel-stack migration. Live-verified: `dom-sync.php`→410, `/api/locations/`→200. |
| **M2** | Correctness bugs | ✅ done | IZ/`bis` word-boundary parsers (`9d4a801b`), spotlight poll cancel (`70a8c1e9`), zoom-band unified to 0-1/2-6 (`8fa18991`), route-graph `calculateRouteServer` shadow removed (`11037917`, live-verified), political loader trio — TOCTOU zoom + edit-time fan-out cache invalidation + pending-rerun + cache eviction (`cacff63b`, deploy-verified; `apiUnavailable` intentionally left self-healing — see commit), `askRegionTabCloseChoice` 3-way dialog (`a78b82d1`). ↪ moved to M5: `refreshPlannerAfterFeatureChange` dedup (harmless dead code in a CRLF file). NB: loader + dialog are client-side; behavioural smoke (open editor, pan/zoom political layer, edit+save a region, close a dirty tab) is the meaningful live test. |
| **M3** | API contract + remove shims (breaking) | ✅ done (substantively) | step 1 frontend tolerance (`00f59fc2`, `apiErrorMessage` + ~40 tolerant reads) → step 2 auth 401/403 split (`3b946189`) → step 3 ALL endpoints on the gold envelope (23 + shared WikiSync handler, `44d02c8d`→`b5054bab`; CORS unified, parallel stack gone) → step 4 lib shims removed (`79de2cbd`+`0bfb68fb`, 7 callers repointed) → step 5 territories-endpoint cleanup (`84b94295`: gold + `?debug_errors` leak dropped + 3 dead `get_` aliases removed). a final repo-wide scan then caught 4 endpoints the cluster sweep missed — `edit/reviews.php` + the `import/location-reports/{index,delete,update-status}.php` cluster — now also migrated (`874ed246`), bringing the total to **27 endpoints**. Step 6 (core folder reorg) **skipped** — marginal/high-churn, root shims deliberately kept for STRATO. A repo-wide scan confirms **ZERO** flat `error:"string"` responses remain in `api/`; messages stay German (English is M8). |
| **M4** | DRY | in progress | ✅ `valid_to_bf`/BF consolidation path A (`139a01c1`, owner-approved, see `docs/m4-valid-to-bf-findings.md`): canonical `avesmapsFormatBfYear` + `avesmapsPoliticalIsOpenEndedDissolved` + plan-query `0=open` align. ⏳ remaining: PHP request runner (deferred — high churn re-touching 27 freshly-migrated endpoints; duplication is now at least uniform), `wiki-crawler-base.php`; JS `territory-utils.js` (≈M5), infobox-row. (No duplicated `debounce` exists.) Path B (full NULL-sentinel migration) deferred as higher-risk. |
| **M5** | God-file splits | in progress | safe-split pattern (no-build classic scripts): extract a contiguous run of **global function declarations** (no top-level state, no load-time code) into a sibling file loaded adjacent in `index.html` → behaviour-identical (functions are global + hoisted, called at runtime). ✅ `review-wiki-sync.js` **1795→692** across two splits (`85ac848f`+`7a76f8bf`): case-list (grouping/filtering/accordion/rendering/create-location) → `review-wiki-sync-cases.js` 725; case-resolution (action buttons/focus-preview/location-pick/resolve dialog) → `review-wiki-sync-resolve.js` 390; all live-verified stamped + served. NOTE: `territory-wiki-tree.js` 947 is already a clean encapsulated IIFE module (zero top-level fns) — **not** a god-file-split candidate; leave as-is. ✅ `map-features.js` **1506→876** (`52a66803`+`81390da9`): region split/move editing → `map-features-region-edit-ops.js` (252), location/crossing marker editing → `map-features-location-editing.js` (381); flat-globals safe pattern, shared state referenced cross-script; live-verified stamped+200. ⚠️ `embedded.js` 3555 is a single **IIFE closure module** (126 closure-scoped fns sharing closure state) like `territory-wiki-tree.js` — the trivial function-move does NOT apply (extraction would need call-site rewiring / namespace = the bigger delegation refactor); **deferred** (owner declined the big refactor; best done when the contested-territories feature is quiescent). ⏳ remaining tiers: (a) more `map-features.js` clusters; (b) `spotlight-search.js` 910 — shared mutable `let` state, fiddly; (c) `embedded.js` delegation refactor (separate, owner sign-off); (d) PHP giants — ✅ `sync-monitor.php` **3854→758** (−80%, `37092719`→`d63a5d65`): extract cohesive function clusters into sibling libs `require_once`'d after the consts so all 4 callers (sync-monitor/paths/settlements/regions endpoints) get them transitively — `-licenses.php` (312), `-parsing.php` (553), `-identity.php` (839), `-model.php` (model derivation + hierarchy editing, 920), `-tree.php` (tree/audit/wiki-rows/clear/sample, 503); core is now consts + crawl/BFS engine. Function-only libs, const/core deps resolve at call time; all 4 endpoints live-verified 401 (no 500) after each. ✅ `territories.php` **2529→951** (`457279af`+`a0797aec`): political-tree building → `territories-tree.php` (621), wiki HTML/wikitext parsing → `territories-parsing.php` (977); core is now cache/refresh/fetch-rows. ⚠️ that file had a copy ending with `}` and NO trailing newline at one point — `split` keeps `}` as the last element, so always cross-check `wc -l` vs `len(split())`. ✅ `locations.php` **1626→1044** (`fd8de3a5`): support helpers + map-feature plumbing + restored sync helpers → `locations-helpers.php` (582); lib pattern, 5 callers transitive (incl. settlement-coat-upload), all live-verified 401. ✅ `edit/map/features.php` endpoint **2309→75** (`192bae22`): all 97 handler functions → new lib `api/_internal/map/features.php` (`require_once`'d before the try/dispatch); endpoint keeps consts + `AvesmapsConflictException` + try/catch match-dispatch. Live-verified POST→401, OPTIONS→204, GET→405, lib→403 (htaccess-denied). **All four PHP giants now done.** ⏳ optionally more clusters from the now-mid-size libs; (e) CSS source split, rename duplicate `political-territory-editor.css`, treat `*-inline.css` as generated. ✅ asset tidy-up: flattened `icons/small_webp/` → `icons/` (40 webp, `44f30cc7`) + rewired index.html/config.js/css/generator + retired old server copies (`fcc39f0d`, manual full deploy — a workflow-only push self-skips via `SKIP_DEPLOY`); live-verified new 200 / old 404 |
| **M6** | Performance | in progress | ✅ coat-of-arms blink — region-label layer reuse instead of teardown (`adeb4f3e`, pulled forward; see below). ✅ DDL out of cache-hit path (`1679f644`): a fresh political-layer cache hit now serves the prebuilt JSON before `avesmapsCreatePdo` / ensure-tables DDL run — the AGENTS.md §10 hottest endpoint; live-verified `X-Avesmaps-Layer-Cache: miss`→`hit`, hierarchy still 200, POST→401. ⏳ remaining: derived-layer N+1 memo, political teardown → signature-skip (full reuse, not just labels), polylabel memo, fetch-interceptor, bound+invalidate fan-out cache |
| **M7** | Schema / SQL | planned | `sql/schema.sql` baseline, document inline-DDL tables, `sql/migrations/`, drop dead schema (`map_feature_relations`, `map_proposals`), reconcile `map_reports` divergence; **keep self-healing inline ensure-tables** |
| **M8** | Docs & i18n | planned | ✅ "no backend" claims fixed at source (`bc175741`: llms.txt/site-summary/README). ⏳ translate ~20 docs + internal error messages to English; rewrite `api/README.md`; **build `?lang=en` i18n overlay (German stays default)** |

Each milestone = small verified commits to `master`, deploy + smoke between
steps, STRATO caution (no looping heavy endpoints).

## Owner decisions (locked in 2026-06-13)

1. **User-facing UI language:** German stays the default. Add a translation
   JSON/XML + `?lang=en` overlay (M8). No inline German→English replacement of UI.
2. **WikiSync DOM playground:** remove it — but only after confirming
   `avesmaps.de/edit → WikiSync` (which runs via `api/edit/wiki/sync.php` +
   `territories-dom.php`, both kept) uses none of it.
3. **API breaking changes:** approved.
4. **Diagnostics endpoints:** stay public. A full inventory is maintained (see
   below). M1 still closes the exception-payload *leaks* (content, not access).
5. **Terrain/type labels:** handled via the i18n overlay (same as decision 1).
6. **Schema strategy:** keep self-healing inline ensure-tables; drop dead
   schemas; in M7 inspect the live DB (read-only) for unused tables.

## Diagnostics endpoint inventory (kept public per decision 4)

- `GET /api/route/?diagnostic=` → `map-data`, `network-data`,
  `location-node-data`, `route-name-data`, `dijkstra-data`, `graph-data`.
- `GET /api/app/political-derived-geometry-debug.php` (leaks exception payload — fix in M1).
- `GET /api/diagnostics/political-schema.php` (admin-gated; no JS caller).
- `api/app/political-territories.php?action=` → `debug`, `audit`,
  `geometry_assignment`, `debug_boundary_contract`/`boundary_contract_debug`,
  `change_log`, `geometry_inventory`, `geometry_collision`.
- `?debug_errors=1` flag on `territories-endpoint.php` and
  `political-territory-display-sync.php` (leaks exception class+message — fix in M1).
- `api/_internal/political/{territories-boundary-debug,territories-debug}.php`
  (internal libs, reached via the above).
- `html/political-boundary-diagnostics.html` (dev page).

## M3 execution plan (the breaking migration — run as a focused session)

Goal: every endpoint converges on the gold-standard envelope
`{ok:true,…}` / `{ok:false,error:{code,message}}` via the shared
`avesmapsErrorResponse` / `avesmapsServerErrorResponse` (already in bootstrap).
The error shape changes from a flat `error:"string"` to `error:{code,message}`,
which the frontend currently reads as a string — so order matters. Do each step
as a small commit + deploy + curl/UI smoke.

**Step 1 — make the frontend tolerant FIRST (backward-compatible, no endpoint change yet). ✅ DONE (`00f59fc2`).**
Added `apiErrorMessage(data, fallback)` in `js/app/api-client.js` (canonical) plus a
guarded fallback in `js/territory/territory-editor-context.js` for the standalone editor
page `html/political-territory-editor.html`, which does NOT load `api-client.js` — so the
helper resolves in every context (main window, inline-host, standalone editor). All ~40
`data.error` string reads (not just the list below — also `review-panels`, `share-link`,
`location-reviews`, `routing`, the editor-context files, and `embedded.js`) now go through
it. Live-verified the deployed helper resolves both the gold `{code,message}` (`/api/route/`)
and a legacy flat `error:"string"` (`political-territories.php`). Editor `ASSET_VERSION`
bumped (`20260613e`). For reference, the originally-scoped sites were:
- `js/app/api-client.js`: `:53,:60,:103,:171,:221,:299,:323,:350,:372,:399` (+ the central wrappers — fixing these covers most consumers).
- Direct `data.error` reads in `js/review/*`: `review-settlement-wiki.js`, `review-settlement-list.js` (×6), `review-region-sync.js` (×2), `review-path-wiki.js`, `review-path-sync.js`, `review-locations.js` (×3), `review-label-wiki.js`; `js/territory/`: `territory-wiki-tree.js:903`, `territory-subtree-display-tools.js:54`, `territory-override-footer.js:175`, `territory-editor-link.js:604/610`.
Once tolerant, the shape flip is safe.

**Step 2 — auth gate. ✅ DONE (`3b946189`).** `avesmapsRequireUserWithCapability` now emits
the gold envelope via `avesmapsErrorResponse` and splits 401 `unauthenticated` (no user) vs
403 `forbidden` (wrong role). Messages stay German (i18n is M8); codes are English. Safe
because no frontend code special-cases 401/403 (only 409→poll). Live-verified:
`GET /api/edit/map/{audit-log,presence}.php` without a session → HTTP 401 +
`{"ok":false,"error":{"code":"unauthenticated","message":"…"}}`.

**Step 3 — migrate endpoints cluster by cluster** (each: replace inline
`{ok:false,error:STRING}` ladders with `avesmapsErrorResponse`/`avesmapsServerErrorResponse`,
unify the catch ladder, drop `getMessage()`/`exception` leaks incl. the `?debug_errors=1`
ones, replace per-endpoint CORS strings with `avesmapsErrorResponse(403,'forbidden_origin',…)`):
app/ (map-features, map-search, coat, territory-detail, location-reviews, share-link,
political-territories, political-territory-display-sync) → edit/map → edit/political →
edit/reports → edit/wiki (sync-monitor/paths/regions/settlements/…) → import →
diagnostics. Migrate `wiki-browser-endpoint.php` off its parallel stack (own
`applyCors`/`respondJson`/PDO/config) onto bootstrap — this also closes the last CORS divergence (decision: drop `Allow-Credentials`).

> **Convention (decided while migrating app/):** use the GLOBAL `avesmapsErrorResponse`
> (bootstrap) with codes `forbidden_origin`/`method_not_allowed`/`invalid_request`/
> `not_found`/`conflict`/`rate_limited`/`server_error`/`service_unavailable`. **Messages stay
> German** (i18n is M8). Per the gold standard (locations/route), controlled
> `InvalidArgumentException`/`RuntimeException` `getMessage()` may be exposed; only
> `PDOException`/`Throwable` get a generic message. `coat.php` is skipped (serves image bytes /
> `text/plain`, no JSON envelope). ⚠️ **STRATO OPcache:** a hot file (e.g. map-features) can keep
> serving the OLD response for a short while after deploy even though rarely-hit files in the same
> deploy already update — re-curl after a beat before concluding a migration failed.
>
> **app/ cluster ✅ DONE** — 8 endpoints migrated + live-verified: `map-search` (`44d02c8d`);
> `territory-detail`+`share-link`+`location-reviews` (`306afbda`); `report-location`+
> `political-territory-display-sync` (`a08491ef`, latter also drops the `?debug_errors` leak);
> `map-features`+`political-derived-geometry-debug` (`9e4536bd`, latter drops dead
> `exception:null`). Remaining app/: `political-territories.php` = the multiplexer → Step 5;
> `political-territory-wiki.php` → `wiki-browser-endpoint.php` parallel stack (end of Step 3).
>
> **edit/map cluster ✅ DONE** — `presence.php` (`3f4c4302`), `audit-log.php` (`9bfbf6ad`),
> `features.php` (`e8570045`, 7 main-handler responses; internal helper catches untouched).
> All live-verified via the 401 (no-session auth gate) + 405 paths.
>
> **edit/political cluster ✅ DONE** — `assignment-zoom-sync.php` (`25a8bb8f`, catch split
> 400/500), `display-overrides.php` (`2b6a425c`), `subtree-display.php` (`2de4e2d0`). All
> live-verified (401 + 405).
>
> **edit/reports + diagnostics ✅ DONE** (`d875cf11`): `edit/reports/locations.php` (401 live-verified;
> NB its auth gate runs BEFORE the method check, so the 405 path isn't externally reachable without a
> session — the 401 is the smoke signal), `diagnostics/political-schema.php` (verified by `php -l`+diff
> only — the `api/diagnostics/` dir is `.htaccess`-denied, so it returns an Apache 403 over HTTP, not
> web-smoke-able). **`api/import/` is EMPTY** (no import endpoint exists — drop it from the plan).
> NEXT (remaining Step 3): edit/wiki cluster (paths, regions, settlements, settlement-coat-upload,
> sync-monitor[260L endpoint], + the 3 M1 410-stubs dom-source/dom-sync/playground-seed; sync.php &
> territories.php have no flat errors) → then `political-territory-wiki.php`→`wiki-browser-endpoint.php`
> parallel-stack migration (the last CORS divergence). `app/political-territories.php` multiplexer = Step 5.
>
> **edit/wiki cluster ✅ DONE** (`779055da`): paths, regions, settlements, settlement-coat-upload,
> sync-monitor (regex; new codes payload_too_large/unsupported_media_type) + shared
> `_internal/wiki/endpoint.php` (`00e7b41c`, behind sync.php/territories.php — also dropped its
> Throwable `debug:{class,message,file,line}` leak). The dom-source/dom-sync/playground-seed M1
> 410-stubs already emit gold; sync.php/territories.php had no own flat errors.
>
> **wiki-browser-endpoint.php ✅ DONE** (`b5054bab`): the public wiki-territory browser (behind
> `app/political-territory-wiki.php`) moved OFF its parallel stack (own config-load/applyCors/PDO/
> respondJson) ONTO bootstrap — closes the **last CORS divergence** (Allow-Credentials dropped).
> Live-verified: success GET returns data, POST→405 gold. (File was pure LF; `grep -lU $'\r'` was
> misleading — Python `newline=''` + LF normalization is the reliable EOL probe/edit for odd files.)
>
> **➡️ Step 3 endpoint migrations COMPLETE.** Every JSON endpoint now emits the gold envelope. The
> only remaining "endpoint" is the `territories-endpoint.php` God-multiplexer — handled in Step 5
> (split read/write), not here.

**Step 4 — remove shims/wrappers/alias actions.** ✅ **Lib shims DONE** (`79de2cbd` repoint + `0bfb68fb`
delete): `api/{political-territory-lib,wiki-sync-lib}.php` deleted after repointing all **7** callers
(not 9+1 — the real count: 5 api/ endpoints [political-schema, assignment-zoom-sync, display-overrides,
subtree-display → `_internal/political/territory.php`; map-features → `_internal/wiki/sync.php`] + 2
`scripts/` maintenance scripts found via a repo-wide grep — the `api/`-scoped grep missed them). The
shims were 1-line passthroughs → behaviour-identical; live-verified the endpoints still serve. Deploy
never deletes, so server copies persist harmlessly. AGENTS.md §10 updated. ⏳ **Still TODO:** drop the
`get_`/non-`get_` alias action pairs in `territories-endpoint.php` — folded into Step 5 (same file;
needs a frontend cross-check of which alias form each caller uses before removing).
⚠️ STRATO: deploy never deletes — web-reachable files get stubs; lib shims (not web entry points) were
safe to delete once no repo code required them.

**Step 5 — `territories-endpoint.php` cleanup.** ✅ **DONE** (`84b94295`). Reality check: the
"multiplexer" is a thin **190-line dispatcher** (not the 2533-line file the old notes implied —
that's a `territories-*.php` *lib*, an M5 concern) that already delegates to
`territories-{read,write,geometry,...}.php` and is cleanly method-separated. So instead of a
physical read/write file split (which would only add wrapper method-routing for no real gain),
this step: migrated CORS 403 / 405 / the catch ladder to `avesmapsErrorResponse`; **dropped the
`?debug_errors` leak** (it appended `avesmapsPoliticalDebugExceptionPayload` to every error); and
**removed the 3 dead `get_` alias actions** (`get_derived_geometry[_sources/_plan]` — frontend only
uses the canonical names, verified repo-wide). Per-action auth left unchanged: `debug`/`audit`/
`geometry_assignment` stay public per **owner decision #4** (which supersedes the old "move behind
review" note). Live-verified (success/400/405/401 + the removed alias now → unknown-action 400).

**Step 6 — root `auth.php`/`bootstrap.php` reorg → SKIPPED (recommended).** The real core files are
already at `api/_internal/{auth,bootstrap}.php`; the root `api/{auth,bootstrap}.php` are thin shims
that **no repo code requires** (every endpoint requires the `_internal/` files directly). Moving the
real files into an `_internal/core/` subfolder would rewrite the require path in ~every endpoint
(high churn, real risk) for zero functional benefit, and deleting the root shims would undo a
deliberate STRATO clean-deploy safety net (the `server-repo-drift` lesson — prod-only files may
require the root path; deploy never deletes). Recommendation: leave as-is. **➡️ M3 is substantively
COMPLETE** — every endpoint speaks the gold envelope, CORS is unified, leaks are closed, lib shims
and dead aliases are gone.

Verify each step: `php -l` changed files, `node --check` changed JS, deploy, then curl the
migrated endpoint (success + an error path) and confirm the frontend still renders errors.

## Open behavioural verification checks (M2 — deployed, not yet UI-smoke-tested)

These two M2 fixes are client-side; they passed `node --check` and are deployed, but their
runtime behaviour was not exercised in a browser. Worth a quick manual pass in the editor:

1. **Political-layer edit freshness** (loader trio, `cacff63b`). In a political/region map mode,
   edit + save a region (colour/zoom/geometry) → the change must appear **immediately**, not after
   up to 60s (the multi-zoom fan-out cache is now cleared on edit-triggered `immediate:true` reloads).
   Also pan/zoom rapidly during a layer load → no stale pan-skip (TOCTOU fix) and no reload storm
   (pending-rerun coalesces). Watch the network tab: no runaway `political-territories` requests.
2. **Dirty region-tab close dialog** (`a78b82d1`). Open a region-edit tab, make an unsaved change,
   click the tab's close (×) → the 3-way dialog **Speichern / Verwerfen / Abbrechen** must appear
   (previously: `ReferenceError`, tab wouldn't close). Check: Speichern saves+closes, Verwerfen
   closes without saving, Abbrechen / Escape / backdrop-click keep the tab open.

## Diagnosed issue — coat-of-arms (Wappen) blink in the Politik view — ✅ FIXED (`adeb4f3e`, pulled forward from M6)

✅ **Fixed (`adeb4f3e`)** by reusing region label tooltips across the political reload instead of
destroying them: `reusableRegionLabelsByKey` (keyed by territory) in `map-features-region-rendering.js`,
snapshot before `clearRenderedRegionLayers()` + orphan cleanup in `finally`
(`map-features-political-territory-loader.js`). On rebuild the pooled layer is reused and `setContent`
(which recreates the `<img>`) only runs when the markup actually changed — so a same-zoom pan (identical
data) keeps the loaded coat `<img>` and no longer blinks. Collision-safe (the resolver resets offsets to
0 and recomputes each run). Reload frequency + polygon rebuild unchanged (contained blast radius). Logic
+ deploy verified; the visual result needs one owner hard-reload to confirm. The broader perf-lever-#1
(skip the political reload entirely on same-zoom pan, or reuse polygons too) remains for M6.

Reported 2026-06-13; diagnosed read-only (NOT caused by M1/M2 — verified).
**Root cause:** in the `political` map mode the whole layer is torn down and rebuilt on every
`moveend`/`zoomend` (`bootstrap.js:55/61`), because the "skip reload on same-zoom pan" guard is
deliberately disabled for political mode (`map-features-political-territory-loader.js:538-542`).
Each rebuild does `clearRenderedRegionLayers()` (`map-features-region-rendering.js:65-77`) then
re-creates every region label tooltip with a **fresh** `<img src="/api/app/coat.php?u=…">`
(`map-features.js:678-679`) → the recreated element re-displays → visible blink. Confined to the
Politik view (boundary-only modes skip same-zoom pan and draw no labels).
Ruled out: `coat.php` atomic-write change `09ee68ad` (serving-safe, always emits bytes, immutable
Cache-Control) and loader-trio `cacff63b` (did not change reload frequency).
**Fix (M6, shared root with perf lever #1 "political full teardown+rebuild per moveend"):** reuse
label layers instead of destroying them — keep tooltips keyed by territory and only `setContent`/
reposition when the coat URL or name actually changed, so the already-loaded `<img>` survives the
reload. Doubles as a pan/zoom perf win. Key files: `map-features-region-rendering.js`,
`map-features-political-territory-loader.js`, `map-features.js`.
